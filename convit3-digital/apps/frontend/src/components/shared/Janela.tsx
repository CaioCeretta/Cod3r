      preserving the aspect ratio, and when it is applied, the image will fill the entire container, potentially cropping
      the image if its aspect ratio doesn't match the aspect ratio of the container
      
      In summary with object cover the image will maintain its aspect ratio, but it might overflow the container, getting
      cropped to ensure no empty space is left, and without it, the default behavior is object: contain, which resizes the
      image to fit entirely inside the container, but it may leave empty spaces if the ar doesn't match
