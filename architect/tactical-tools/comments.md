  ○ As well as the strategic tools, we are going to see multiple tactical tools that are in the DDD book: entities, object
  of value, domain services, application services, repositories, DTOs, facades, project patterns, hexagonal architectures,
  among others. All these are tactical tools that will help us on developing our apps.

    ■ The idea is to focus on tactical ideas that will bring a "timeless character" to our app. And by timeless we are
    saying that it is an app that may resist to the time, an app that may have protection to the frameworks and libraries
    that change all the time, but our project be protected of these external changes.
