## In this folder, we are going to create an e-commerce using Object Oriented Programming

  ▣ In procedural function, once we passed through the main concepts, such as scope, stack, functions, parameters input,
  relationship between data and a function and a function as a data transformer, be it by transforming a data it received
  as a parameter or transforming a data of a bigger scope, such as global, this is how functional programming works.

  ● POO Paradigm

    ○ POO couples data and behavior, where we had "unattached" functions before, where a function call other, receiving
    parameters or not. Inside POO we have functions inside a structure, which is also a data, and within it, we may have
    types such as string, number, boolean, and each data is going to be managed by a data structure, and this object
    can reference another objects and the object can also have functions inside of it. Therefore, it's like a capsule that
    couples both the elements. 

    ○ Every programming is based on data and behavior, and this is no be different in POO. In fact, the object itself represent
    custom data, which becomes part of the behaviors defined within it. Instead of having detached functions modifying global
    data or data that exists outside their scope, OOP couples functions and data inside within a single that references 
    itself. 

    ○ Before, when OOP still didn't exist, it was basically inputs transformed by the function and returning an output.
    Now with OO, we get the function's structure — in a similar manner, getting inputs, transforming and returning them —
    but this structure, besides the functions, own the data.

    ○ However, what happens now is that in many cases, we won't need to receive the inputs, because the data can already
    exist within the object, in a way that a function that once received three parameters, now doesn't receive any, because
    all the data belong to the object. Meaning that this function don't need to receive the data from outside.
