# Overall comments about the project

## Some explanations may be on the docs folder, utilizing diagrams

  ● The instructor opted by creating the front-end first for us to have a visual feedback

  ● docs folder and project planning
    ○ Inside the docs folder, we've created an `interface.excalidraw` 
    ○ First, we'll worry about registering a vote inside the app
    ○ Then, eventually we are going to create a CRUD for registering candidates, parties, voters, etc

  ● Inside src, we can create a data folder, where will be placed codes like the models and constants so we can initially
  mock the data for us to access them through the workspace and later think on databases.

    ○ We also can, in the future, refactor the project, and move this model to another project, because in the future we
    can create a folder to separate the model to the front end.

    ○ However, the focus is, to put the codes in a more simple manner, and refactor along with the coding, the focus is
    to understand how to start a project, which is a tunnel with a curve, we won't necessarilly see the end of it and how
    it will end, we "walk with it" make the adjustements, and at the end, see the project output

  ● App folder will be responsible to hold our UI/Pages the app will eventually have.  

  ● Start by creating the data/model/Candidate.ts, which, for the first moment, is going to be an interface not a class
  and eventually, the code will start evolving.
    ○ Create the candidates.ts inside constants with the json generated by gpt

  ● Inside components folder, create the folder to separate the components we are going to work with on each pae,

  ● Inside app, where we will have our pages, and create folder (groups) for a better separation.

    ○ app/(admin) <- Only for administration pages
      ■ Which in this folder, we can separate into candidates and voters
    ○ add/(voting) <- Specific folder for who works and make use of the voting interface
    
  ● Within the components folder, create a new folder shared, with components to be used across different pages, and inside
  it, create a component Page.tsx, which will be used as layout to our application

  ● Create a .container class on our global.css and use this class inside the main tag of div, and on other classes to
  maintain the width

  ● For excluding candidates, the delete candidate function could not belong to the list of candidates, since it do not
  "own" the state. Therefore, what we have to pass down a function to the children for indirect communication.

  ● When dea
